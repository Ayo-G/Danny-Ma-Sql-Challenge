Data Cleansing Steps
------------------ */
/*
In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the data_mart schema named clean_weekly_sales:

- Convert the week_date to a DATE format

- Add a week_number as the second column for each week_date value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc

- Add a month_number with the calendar month for each week_date value as the 3rd column

- Add a calendar_year column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values

- Add a new column called age_band after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value

segment - age_band 
1 - Young Adults 
2 - Middle Aged 
3 or 4 - Retirees

- Add a new demographic column using the following mapping for the first letter in the segment values:
segment - demographic 
C - Couples 
F - Families

- Ensure all null string values with an "unknown" string value in the original segment column as well as the new age_band and demographic columns

- Generate a new avg_transaction column as the sales value divided by transactions rounded to 2 decimal places for each record

Data Exploration
-------------- */
-- What day of the week is used for each week_date value?
-- What range of week numbers are missing from the dataset?
-- How many total transactions were there for each year in the dataset?
-- What is the total sales for each region for each month?
-- What is the total count of transactions for each platform
-- What is the percentage of sales for Retail vs Shopify for each month?
-- What is the percentage of sales by demographic for each year in the dataset?
-- Which age_band and demographic values contribute the most to Retail sales?
-- Can we use the avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?

Before and after Analysis
----------------------- */
/*
This technique is usually used when we inspect an important event and want to inspect the impact before and after a certain point in time.

Taking the week_date value of 2020-06-15 as the baseline week where the Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect.

We would include all week_date values for 2020-06-15 as the start of the period after the change and the previous week_date values would be before

Using this analysis approach - answer the following questions:

- What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? - What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?
- What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?
- How do the sale metrics for these 2 periods before and after compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?
